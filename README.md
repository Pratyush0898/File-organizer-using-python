# File Organizer Using Python

A Python project to automatically organize files in a directory based on their file types. The script moves files into corresponding folders (like Images, Documents, Videos, etc.) to keep your directories tidy.

## **Files:**

- **organizer.py**: The main Python script to organize files in a specified directory.
- **disorganizer.py**: A complementary script that can "disorganize" the files by moving them back to their original directory, useful for testing.

## **Usage:**

1. **Run `organizer.py`** to organize files:
   ```bash
   python organizer.py
   ```
   The script will prompt you for a directory path and then sort the files into categorized folders.

2. **Run `disorganizer.py`** to revert the organization:
   ```bash
   python disorganizer.py
   ```
   This script will move files back to their original location, undoing the organization.

## **Customization:**

You can modify the scripts to add more file categories or change the organization rules according to your needs.
